After the assets are loaded, add a `.env` file with the following:

```
GRAPH_CMS_TOKEN={your_token}
ENDPOINT={your_endpoint}
```

### `npm i`

Run the command above to install the packages.

### run

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
